<h1>PWM</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The NUC400 has two PWM generators гн PWM0 and PWM1. PWM0 supports 6 channels PWM 
output or 6 channels input capture, and these two functions share the same pins (PWM0_CH0/ 
PWM0_CH1/PWM0_CH2/PWM0_CH3/PWM0_CH4/PWM0_CH5).  PWM1  supports  6  channels 
PWM  output  or  6  channels  input  capture,  and  these  two  functions  share  the  same  pins 
(PWM1_CH0/PWM1_CH1/PWM1_CH2/ PWM1_CH3/PWM1_CH4/PWM1_CH5). 
The PWM generator  has 16-bit PWM counter and comparator, and the PWM counter supports 
edge-aligned or center-aligned operating types. The PWM generator supports two standard PWM 
output modes: Independent output mode and Complementary output mode with 8-bit Dead-zone 
generator. In addition, PWM generator supports two special output mode: Synchronize mode and 
Group mode. It also has 8-bit prescaler and clock divider with 5 divided frequencies (1, 1/2, 1/4, 
1/8, 1/16) to support wide range clock frequency of PWM counter. For PWM output control unit, it 
supports  polarity  output  function,  independent  pin  mask  function  and  brake  function.  PWM 
generator  can  send  ADC  start  trigger  signal  if  one  of  the  following  conditions  happened:  PWM 
counter period point, PWM counter center point, PWM output rising edge and PWM output falling 
edge. 
The PWM generator also supports input capture function. It supports latch PWM counter value to 
corresponding  register  when  input  channel  has  a  rising  transition,  falling  transition  or  both 
transition is happened. </li>
