<h1>PS2</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NUC200 PS/2 device controller provides a basic timing control for PS/2 communication. All communication
between the device and the host is managed through the PS2_CLK and PS2_DAT pins. Unlike
PS/2 keyboard or mouse device controller, the receive/transmit code needs to be translated as
meaningful code by firmware. The device controller generates the PS2_CLK signal after receiving
a ¡°Request to Send¡± state, but host has ultimate control over communication. Data of PS2_DAT
line sent from the host to the device is read on the rising edge and sent from the device to the
host is change after rising edge. A 16 bytes FIFO is used to reduce CPU intervention. Software
can select 1 to 16 bytes for a continuous transmission.</li>
