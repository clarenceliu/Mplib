<h1>OPAMP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    The STM32F30xx embeds four operational amplifiers that can either be used as standalone 
amplifiers or as follower / programmable gain amplifiers. The operational amplifier output is 
internally connected to an ADC channel for measurement purposes.
OPAMP main features :
<li>Rail-to-rail input/output</li>
<li>Low offset voltage</li>
<li>Capability of being configured as a standalone operational amplifier or as a programmable gain amplifier (PGA)</li>
<li>Access to all terminals </li>
<li>Input multiplexer on inverting and non-inverting input</li>
<li>Input multiplexer can be triggered by a timer and synchronized with a PWM signal.</li>
</ul>
