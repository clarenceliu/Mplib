<h1>TMRD</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<pre>
TMRD consists of two timer units (TMRD0 and TMRD1) and two clock setting circuits (prescalers) for
supply-ing clocks to these timer units. The functions are as follows.
    * 16-bit interval timer
    * 16-bit programmable pulse generation (PPG)

16-bit interval timer has the following two modes.
    * Timer mode that TMRD0 and TMRD1 operate independently.
    * Interlock timer mode that can start TMRD0 and TMRD1 at the same time.

16-bit programmable pulse generation has the following two modes.
    * PPG mode that TMRD0 and TMRD1 independently output preprogrammed pulses.
    * PPG mode that can change the phase releations between the pilse output by TMRD0 and that output by

TMRD1 in the range from -180 degree to +180 degree.
