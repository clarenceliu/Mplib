<h2>Overview</h2>

<ul>
The TMPM341FDXBG/FYXBG has a built-in external bus interface function to connect to external memory, I/
Os, etc.
</ul>

<ul>
This interface consists of an external bus interface circuit (EBIF), a chip selector (CS) and a wait controller.
The chip selector and wait controller designate mapping addresses in a 2-block address space and also control
wait states and data bus widths (8- or 16-bit) in these and other external address spaces.
The external bus interface circuit (EBIF) controls the timing of external buses based on the chip selector and
wait controller settings.
</ul>

<ul>
This product is a bi-endian capable product that supports both little and big endian byte ordering used for the
CPU core Cortex-M3. This chapter mainly describes the CS/Wait controller. For information about bi-endian, see
the chapter Endian.
