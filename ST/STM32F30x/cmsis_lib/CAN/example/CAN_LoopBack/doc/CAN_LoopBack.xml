    <Description>
  This example provides a description of how to set a communication with the CAN
in loopback mode.

The CAN cell first performs a transmission and a reception of a standard data
frame by polling at 125 Kbps. The received frame is checked and some LEDs light
up to indicate whether the communication was successful. Then, an extended data
frame is transmitted at 500 Kbps. Reception is done in the interrupt handler
when the message becomes pending in the FIFO. Finally, the LEDs indicate if both
transmission and reception have been successful.
 - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up 
    - Use LED1, LED2, LED3 and LED4 connected respectively to PE.08, PE.09, PE.10
      and PE.11 pins
