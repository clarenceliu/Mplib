<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The  Secure-Digital  Host  Controller  (SD  Host)  has  DMAC  unit  and  SD  unit.  The  DMAC  unit 
provides  a  DMA  (Direct  Memory  Access)  function  for  SD  to  exchange  data  between  system 
memory and shared buffer (128 bytes), and the SD unit controls the interface of SD/SDHC. The 
SDHOST controller can support SD/SDHC and the FMI  is cooperated  with DMAC to provide  a 
fast data transfer between system memory and cards. </li>
