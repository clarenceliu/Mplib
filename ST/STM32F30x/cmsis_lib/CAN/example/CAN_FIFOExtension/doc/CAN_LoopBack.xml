    <Description>
  This example shows how to configure the CAN peripheral to send and receive 
CAN frames in normal mode using FIFO0 and FIFO1. This application example shows 
how to manage the both CAN FIFO as a single FIFO composed by 6 mail boxes.

The CAN serial communication link is a bus to which a number of units may be
connected. This number has no theoretical limit. Practically the total number
of units will be limited by delay times and/or electrical loads on the bus line.

This program behaves as follows:
  - By Pressing on KEY Button : 6 messages are sent to the N eval boards 
    connected to the bus and the received messages are displayed on the LCD. 
  Each time a new 6 messages are sent.
    
@note This example is tested with a bus of 3 units. The same program example is 
      loaded in all units to send and receive frames.
@note Any unit in the CAN bus may play the role of sender (by pressing KEY button)
      or receiver.

The CAN is configured as follow:
    - Bit Rate   = 1 Mbit/s  
    - CAN Clock  = external clock (HSE)
    - ID Filter  = All identifiers are allowed
    - RTR = Data
    - DLC = 1 byte
    - Data: Led number that should be turned ON
