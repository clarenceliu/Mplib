<h1>SPI</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The  Serial  Peripheral  Interface  (SPI)  is  a  synchronous  serial  data  communication  protocol  that 
operates  in  full  duplex  mode.  Devices  communicate  in  Master/Slave  mode  with  the  4-wire  bi-direction  interface. The  NUC400 series contains  up to four sets of SPI controllers performing  a serial-to-parallel conversion  on  data  received  from  a  peripheral device,  and  a  parallel-to-serial conversion  on  data  transmitted  to  a  peripheral  device.  Each  set  of  SPI  controller  can  be configured as a master or a slave device¡£ 
The SPI controller supports 2-bit Transfer mode to connect 2 off-chip slave devices at the same time. This controller also supports the PDMA function to access the data buffer and also supports Dual and Quad I/O Transfer mode. </li>
