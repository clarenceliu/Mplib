<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>STMicro STM32F30X Series has up to 80 General Purpose I/O pins can be shared with other function pins; 
    it depends on the chip configuration. These 80 pins are arranged in 6 ports named with GPIOA, GPIOB, GPIOC , GPIOD, GPIOE and GPIOF. 
    Each port equips maximum 16 pins. Each one of the 80 pins is independent and has the corresponding register bits 
    to control the pin mode function and data. </li>
