<h1>COMP</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  The STM32F30xxx embeds seven general purpose comparators that can be used either as 
standalone devices (all terminal are available on I/Os) or combined with the timers. They 
can be used for a variety of functions including:Wake-up from low-power mode triggered by an analog signal; Analog signal conditioning;Cycle-by-cycle current control loop when combined with the DAC and a PWM output from a timer.
	COMP main features
    	<li>Rail-to-rail comparators</li>
	<li>Each comparator has configurable positive and negative inputs used for flexible voltage selection:
¨C Multiplexed I/O pins
¨C DAC channel 1 or DAC channel 2
¨C Internal reference voltage and three submultiple values (1/4, 1/2, 3/4) provided by 
scaler (buffered voltage divider).</li>
	<li>Programmable hysteresis</li>
	<li>Programmable speed and consumption</li>
	<li>COMP1 and COMP2, COMP3/COMP4, and COMP5/COMP6 comparators can be 
combined in a window comparator. COMP7 does not support the window mode.</li>
	<li>Comparators output with blanking source</li>
	<li>Each comparator has interrupt generation capability with wake-up from Sleep and Stop modes (through the EXTI controller)</li>
    	
</ul>
