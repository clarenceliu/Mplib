<h1>UART</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) performs a serial-to-parallel
conversion on data received from the peripheral, and a parallel-to-serial conversion on data
transmitted from the CPU. The UART controller also supports IrDA SIR Function and RS-485
mode functions. Each UART channel supports six types of interrupts including transmitter FIFO
empty interrupt (INT_THRE), receiver threshold level reaching interrupt (INT_RDA), line status
interrupt (parity error or framing error or break interrupt) (INT_RLS), receiver buffer time out
interrupt (INT_TOUT), MODEM/Wake-up status interrupt (INT_MODEM) and Buffer error interrupt
(INT_BUF_ERR). Interrupts of UART0 number is 12 (vector number is 28); Interrupt number 13
(vector number is 29) supports UART1 interrupt. Refer to Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller
chapter for System Interrupt Map.
The UART0 and UART1 are built-in with a 16-byte transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO) and a 16-byte
receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO) that reduces the number of interrupts presented to the CPU. The CPU
can read the status of the UART at any time during the operation. The reported status information
includes the type and condition of the transfer operations being performed by the UART, as well
as 4 error conditions (parity error, framing error, break interrupt and buffer error) probably occur
while receiving data. The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that is capable of
dividing clock input by divisors to produce the serial clock that transmitter and receiver need. The
baud rate equation is Baud Rate = UART_CLK / M * [BRD + 2], where M and BRD are defined in
Baud Rate Divider Register (UA_BAUD).</li>
