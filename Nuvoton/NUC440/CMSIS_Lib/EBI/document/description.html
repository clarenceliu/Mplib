<h1>EBI</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The NUC400 series is equipped with an external bus interface (EBI) for external device use. To 
minimize the connections between external device and this chip, EBI supports address bus and 
data bus multiplex mode. Also, the address latch enable (ALE) signal supported differentiate the 
address and data cycle. 
In  consideration  of  pin  resource,  address  and  Data  separate  mode  can  improve  the  EBI 
performance and save the address latch.  </li>
