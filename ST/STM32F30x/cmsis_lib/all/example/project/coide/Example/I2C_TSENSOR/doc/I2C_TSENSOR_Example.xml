    <Description>
    This example provides a description of how to use the I2C to communicate with 
an STTS751 (or a compatible device) I2C temperature sensor is mounted on the 
STM32303C-EVAL board and used to get instantaneous external temperature (-55 to +125).
 
Thanks to STM32 I2C SMBus feature, we can easily monitor the temperature 
variations. This is managed by the SMBus Alert which is generating a dedicated 
interrupt informing the system that the temperature is out of the selected 
ranges.
The user can configure the TOS and THYS thanks to a dedicated define values in 
the code.

By default the STM32303C-EVAL demo are setting them to (see main.c file):
  
#define TEMPERATURE_THYS        0x14 /* 20 */
#define TEMPERATURE_TOS         0x28 /* 40 */
 - STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Make sure that JP5 and JP6 jumpers are fitted in position 1-2.
    - Make sure that JP1 jumper is fitted.
