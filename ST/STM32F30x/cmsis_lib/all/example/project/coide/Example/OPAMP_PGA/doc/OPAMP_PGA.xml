    <Description>
    This example shows how to configure OPAMP1 peripheral to amplify applied signal
on OPAMP1 non inverting input using the built-in PGA.
OPAMP1 is configured as following:
   - PGA mode enabled with gain set to 2
   - Non Inverting input is connected to PA5
   - Output is available on PA2

In this configuration the OPAMP1 amplifies the signal on PA5.
In this example the DAC peripheral is configured to generate a sine wave signal
on DAC_OUT2 (PA5) which will be amplified by the OPAMP1.

- Connect an oscilloscope to DAC_OUT2 (PA5) to display the sine wave signal
  generated by the DAC. 
- Connect an oscilloscope to OPAMP1 Out (PA2) to display the amplified (by 2)
  sine wave signal.
