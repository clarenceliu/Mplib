<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Real Time Clock (RTC) controller provides the real time clock and calendar information. The 
clock source of RTC controller is from an external 32.768 kHz low-speed crystal which connected 
at  pins  X32I  and  X32O  (refer  to  pin  Description)  or  from  an  external  32.768  kHz  low-speed 
oscillator output fed at pin X32I. The RTC controller  provides the real time clock (hour, minute, 
second) in TLR (RTC Time Loading Register) as well as calendar information (year, month, day) 
in CLR (RTC Calendar Loading Register). It also offers RTC alarm function that user can preset 
the  alarm  time  in  TAR  (RTC  Time  Alarm  Register)  and  alarm  calendar  in  CAR  (RTC  Calendar 
Alarm Register). The data format of RTC time and calendar message are all expressed in BCD 
(Binary Coded Decimal) format. </li>
