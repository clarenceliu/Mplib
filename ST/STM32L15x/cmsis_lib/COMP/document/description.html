<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>An analog comparator is a peripheral that compares two analog voltages, and provides a logical output that signals the comparison result.The comparator can provide its output to a device pin, acting as a replacement for an analog comparator on the board, or it can be used to signal the application via interrupts or triggers to the ADC to cause it to start capturing a sample sequence. The interrupt generation and ADC triggering logic is separate. This means, for example, that an interrupt can be generated on a rising edge and the ADC triggered on a falling edge.</li>
</ul>
