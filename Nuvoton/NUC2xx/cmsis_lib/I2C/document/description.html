<h1>I2C</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>I2C is a two-wire, bidirectional serial bus that provides a simple and efficient method of data
exchange between devices. The I2C standard is a true multi-master bus including collision
detection and arbitration that prevents data corruption if two or more masters attempt to control
the bus simultaneously.
Data is transferred between a Master and a Slave. Data bits transfer on the SCL and SDA lines
are synchronously on a byte-by-byte basis. Each data byte is 8-bit long. There is one SCL clock
pulse for each data bit with the MSB being transmitted first, and an acknowledge bit follows each
transferred byte. Each bit is sampled during the high period of SCL; therefore, the SDA line may
be changed only during the low period of SCL and must be held stable during the high period of
SCL. A transition on the SDA line while SCL is high is interpreted as a command (START or
STOP). Please refer to Figure 5-18 for more detailed I2C BUS Timing.</li>
