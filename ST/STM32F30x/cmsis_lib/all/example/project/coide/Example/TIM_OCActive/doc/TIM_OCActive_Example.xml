    <Description>
  This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate four different 
signals with four different delays.

The TIM3CLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), and the objective is
to get TIM3 counter clock at 10 KHz so the Prescaler is computed as following:
   - Prescaler = (TIM3CLK / TIM3 counter clock) - 1
   
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for stm32f30x Devices.

The TIM3 CCR1 register value is equal to 1000:
TIM3_CH1 delay = CCR1_Val/TIM3 counter clock  = 100 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 1 generates a signal with a delay equal to 100 ms.

The TIM3 CCR2 register value is equal to 50:
TIM3_CH2 delay = CCR2_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 50 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 2 generates a signal with a delay equal to 50 ms.

The TIM3 CCR3 register value is equal to 25:
TIM3_CH3 delay = CCR3_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 25 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 3 generates a signal with a delay equal to 25 ms.

The TIM3 CCR4 register value is equal to 12.5:
TIM3_CH4 delay = CCR4_Val/TIM3 counter clock = 12.5 ms
so the TIM3 Channel 4 generates a signal with a delay equal to 12.5 ms.

The delay correspond to the time difference between PE.08 and  TIM3_CHx signal
rising edges.
