<h1>(USART</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
	The universal synchronous asynchronous receiver transmitter (USART) offers a flexible 
means of full-duplex data exchange with external equipment requiring an industry standard 
NRZ asynchronous serial data format. The USART offers a very wide range of baud rates 
using a baud rate generator. It supports synchronous one-way communication and half-duplex single wire communication. It also supports the LIN (local interconnection network), Smartcard Protocol and IrDA (infrared data association) SIR ENDEC specifications, and modem operations 
(CTS/RTS). It allows multiprocessor communication.  
	<li>Full duplex, asynchronous communications</li>
	<li>Continuous communication using DMA (direct memory access)</li>
	<li>Programmable data word length (8 or 9 bits)</li>
	<li>Dual clock domain allowing.
¨C UART functionality and wakeup from Stop mode
¨C Convenient baud rate programming independent from the PCLK reprogramming </li>
	<li>Baud rate generator systems. A common programmable transmit and receive baud rate of up to 9 Mbit/s when the clock frequency is 72 MHz and oversampling is by 8</li>
	<li>Continuous communication using DMA (direct memory access)</li>
</ul>
