    <Description>
   This example shows how to configure the TIM1 peripheral to generate 3 PWM combined 
signals with TIM1 Channel5.

TIM1 input clock (TIM1CLK) is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2)=> TIM1CLK = PCLK2 = SystemCoreClock
TIM1CLK = SystemCoreClock, Prescaler = 0, TIM1 counter clock = SystemCoreClock
SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz for STM32F30x devices.

The objective is to generate 3 combined PWM signal at 8.78 KHz (in center aligned mode):
    - TIM1_Period = (SystemCoreClock / (8.78*2)) - 1
 The channel 1  duty cycle is set to 50%.
 The channel 2  duty cycle is set to 37.5%.
 The channel 3  duty cycle is set to 25%.
   
The Timer pulse is calculated as follows:
  - ChannelxPulse = DutyCycle * (TIM1_Period - 1) / 100
  
The channel 5  is used in PWM2 mode with duty cycle set to 6.22%.

The 3 resulting signals are made of an AND logical combination of two reference PWMs:
  - Channel 1 and Channel 5
	- Channel 2 and Channel 5
	- Channel 3 and Channel 5
- STM32303C-EVAL Set-up
    - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
       - PA.08 (TIM1_CH1)
       - PA.09 (TIM2_CH2)
       - PA.10 (TIM2_CH3)
