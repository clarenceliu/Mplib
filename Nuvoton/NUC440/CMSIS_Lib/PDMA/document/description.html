<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The direct memory access (DMA) controller is used to provide high-speed data transfer. The DMA 
controller can module transfers data from one address to another without CPU intervention. This 
has  the  benefit  of  reducing  the  workload  of  CPU  and  keeps  CPU  resources  free  for  other 
applications.  The  DMA  controllers  have  a  total  of  16  channels  and  each  channel  can  perform 
transfer between memory and peripherals or between memory and memory.  </li>
</ul>
