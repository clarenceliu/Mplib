<h1>DMA</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Direct memory access (DMA) is used in order to provide high-speed data transfer between peripherals and memory as well as memory to memory. Data can be quickly moved by DMA without any CPU actions. This keeps CPU resources free for other operations.</li>
</ul>
