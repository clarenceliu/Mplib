				This example describes how to use the ADC3 and TIM8 to convert continuously data 
			from ADC3 channel8.

			The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously channel8(for STM324x9I-EVAL RevB).

			Each time an external trigger is generated by TIM8 a new converson is started by ADC3.
			At the end of conversion an interrupt is generated and the converted data of 
			ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedValue variable in the ADC 
			conversion complete call back function. 

			In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 = 72MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
			Since ADC3 clock is 36 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
			time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/36= 0.41us(2.4Msps).
