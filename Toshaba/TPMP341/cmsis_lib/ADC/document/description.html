<h1>ADC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<pre>
TMPM341FDXBG/FYXBG contains a 12-bit, sequential-conversion analog/digital converter (ADC) with 15 an-alog input channels.
These 15 analog input channels (pins AIN00 through AIN14) are also used as input/output ports.
The 12-bit AD converter has the following features:

* Starting normal AD conversion and highest-priority AD conversion
      Software activation
      Activation with the 16-bit timer (TMRB)
      Hardware activation with an external trigger input (ADTRG pin)
* AD conversion
      Fixed-channel single conversion mode
      Channel scan single conversion mode
      Fixed-channel repeat conversion mode
      Channel scan repeat conversion mode
* Highest-priority AD conversion
* Normal AD conversion completion interrupt and highest-priority AD conversion completion interrupt
* Normal AD conversion and highest-priority AD conversion status flags.
      A flag indicating the AD conversion result data is valid, <ADRxRF>
      A flag indicating the AD conversion result data is overwritten, <OVRx>
      Normal AD conversion completion flag and highest-priority AD conversion completion flag
      Normal AD conversion busy flag and highest-priority AD conversion busy flag
* AD Monitor Function
      When the AD monitor function is enabled, an interrupt is generated if any comparison result is matched.
* AD conversion clock can be controlled from 1/fc to 1/16fc.
* When AD conversion is completed, two types of DMA requests are supported.
* Standby mode is supported.
* Output switching monitor function

This is the function that monitors output switching operation of general
input-output ports, which is al-so used as analog input channels (pins AIN00
through AIN14), during AD conversion. This monitor func-tion is used to suggest
the possibility that output switching operation during AD conversion affects
conver-sion accuracy.
