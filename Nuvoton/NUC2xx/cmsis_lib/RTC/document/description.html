<h1>RTC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Real Time Clock (RTC) controller provides user with the real time and calendar message.
The clock source of RTC controller is from an external 32.768 kHz low speed crystal which
connected at pins X32_IN and X32_OUT (refer to pin Description) or from an external 32.768 kHz
low speed oscillator output fed at pin X32_IN. The RTC controller provides the real time message
(hour, minute, second) in TLR (RTC Time Loading Register) as well as calendar message (year,
month, day) in CLR (RTC Calendar Loading Register). It also offers RTC alarm function that user
can preset the alarm time in TAR (RTC Time Alarm Register) and alarm calendar in CAR (RTC
Calendar Alarm Register). The data format of RTC time and calendar message are all expressed
in BCD format.
The RTC controller supports periodic RTC Time Tick and Alarm Match interrupts. The periodic
RTC Time Tick interrupt has 8 period interval options 1/128, 1/64, 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, 1/4, 1/2 and 1
second which are selected by TTR (TTR[2:0] Time Tick Register). When real time and calendar
message in TLR and CLR are equal to alarm time and calendar settings in TAR and CAR, the AIF
(RIIR [0] RTC Alarm Interrupt Flag) is set to 1 and the RTC alarm interrupt signal is generated if
the AIER (RIER [0] Alarm Interrupt Enable) is enabled.
Both RTC Time Tick and Alarm Match interrupt signal can cause chip to wake-up from Idle or
Power-down mode if the correlate interrupt enable bit (AIER or TIER) is set to 1 before chip
enters Idle or Power-down mode.</li>
