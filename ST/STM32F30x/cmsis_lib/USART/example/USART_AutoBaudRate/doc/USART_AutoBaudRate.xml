    <Description>
     This example provides a description of how to use the Auto BaudRate capability
of the USART via the HyperTerminal.

First, the USART1 is configured to detect BaudRate automatically with StartBit
Measurement Method (Any character starting with a bit at 1 should be send to USART 
to detect Baud Rate).

After configuration, the USART waits until a data is received via HyperTerminal
to launch auto-detection of Baud Rate phase. The end of this phase is monitored 
by ABRF flag.

The result of auto-detection is indicated by Eval_Board LEDs. If an error occurred 
in Auto BaudRate phase ABRE flag is set and LED3 is turned on. If this phase is 
completed successfully, LED2 is turned on and the received data is transmitted to
HyperTerminal.

The USART1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud (any value can be chosen)  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - One Stop Bit
    - No parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
