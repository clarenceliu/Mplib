<h1>GPIO</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NThe NuMicro NUC200 series has up to 80 General Purpose I/O pins to be shared with other
function pins depending on the chip configuration. These 80 pins are arranged in 6 ports named
as GPIOA, GPIOB, GPIOC, GPIOD, GPIOE and GPIOF. The GPIOA/B/C/D/E port has the
maximum of 16 pins and GPIOF port has the maximum of 4 pins. Each of the 80 pins is
independent and has the corresponding register bits to control the pin mode function and data.
The I/O type of each of I/O pins can be configured by software individually as input, output, opendrain
or Quasi-bidirectional mode. After reset, the I/O mode of all pins are depending on
Config0[10] setting. In Quasi-bidirectional mode, I/O pin has a very weak individual pull-up
resistor which is about 110~300 K? for VDD is from 5.0 V to 2.5 V.</li>
