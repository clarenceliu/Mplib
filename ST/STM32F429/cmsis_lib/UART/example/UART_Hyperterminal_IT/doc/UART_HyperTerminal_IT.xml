    <Description>
    This example provides a description of how to use the EVAL_COM1 when using the
STM32303C-EVAL Transmit and Receive interrupts to communicate with the hyperterminal.

First, the EVAL_COM1 sends the TxBuffer to the hyperterminal and still waiting for 
a string from the hyperterminal that you must enter.The string that you have entered 
is stored in the RxBuffer array. The receive buffer have a RxBufferSize bytes as 
maximum (the reception is stopped when this maximum receive value is reached).

The EVAL_COM1 is configured as follow:
    - BaudRate = 9600 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits (7 data bit + 1 parity bit)
    - Two Stop Bit
    - Odd parity
    - Hardware flow control disabled (RTS and CTS signals)
    - Receive and transmit enabled
