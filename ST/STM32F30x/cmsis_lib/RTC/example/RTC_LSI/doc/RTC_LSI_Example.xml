    <Description>
     This example demonstrates and explains how to use the LSI clock source auto
calibration to get a precise RTC clock. 
As an application example, it demonstrates how to configure the TIM16 timer
internally connected to LSI clock output, in order to adjust the RTC prescaler. 

The Low Speed Internal (LSI) clock is used as RTC clock source.
After reset, the RTC prescaler (asynchronous and synchronous) is set with the 
default LSI frequency (42KHz).
The RTC wakeup is configured to generate an interrupt each 1s. LED1 is toggled 
inside the RTC WakeUp interrupt each 1s.

The inaccuracy of the LSI clock causes the RTC wakeup Interrupt to be inaccurate.
The RTC CK_SPRE signal can be monitored by LED1 which is toggled into the RTC 
wakeup interrupt service routine.

The program waits until Key Push button is pressed to begin the auto calibration 
procedure:
 - Configure the TIM16 to remap internally the TIM16 Channel 1 Input Capture to 
   the LSI clock output.
 - Enable the TIM16 Input Capture interrupt: after one cycle of LSI clock, the
   period value is stored in a variable and compared to the HCLK clock to get
   its real value.
 - The RTC prescaler is adjusted with this LSI frequency value so that the RTC
   CK_SPRE value become more accurate.
 - When calibration is done LED2 is turned ON to indicate the end of this operation.
