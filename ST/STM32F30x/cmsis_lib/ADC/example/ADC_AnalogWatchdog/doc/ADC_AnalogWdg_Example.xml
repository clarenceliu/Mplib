    <Description>
   This example describes how to use the ADC analog watchdog to guard continuously  
an ADC channel.
The ADC1 is configured to convert continuously ADC channel7. 
The analog watchdog is configured and enabled to guard a single regular channel.
Each time the channel7 converted value exceeds programmed analog watchdog high 
threshold (value 0x7F) or goes down analog watchdog low threshold (value 0x1F)
an AWD interrupt is generated and the output pin connected to LED4 is toggled. 
The LED will bright as long as the AWD interrupt is generated which means that the 
converted value of regular ADC channel7 is outside the range limited by high and 
low analog watchdog thresholds.
