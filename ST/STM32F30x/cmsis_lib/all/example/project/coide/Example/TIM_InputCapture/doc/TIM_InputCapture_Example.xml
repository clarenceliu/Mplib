    <Description>
  This example shows how to use the TIM peripheral to measure the frequency of an 
external signal.

The TIMxCLK frequency is set to SystemCoreClock (Hz), the Prescaler is 0 so the 
TIM2 counter clock is SystemCoreClock (Hz).

SystemCoreClock is set to 72 MHz.

TIM2 is configured in Input Capture Mode: the external signal is connected to 
TIM2 Channel2 used as input pin.
To measure the frequency we use the TIM2 CC2 interrupt request,
so In the TIM2_IRQHandler routine, the frequency of the external signal is computed. 
The "TIM2Freq" variable contains the external signal frequency:
TIM2Freq = TIM2 counter clock / Capture in Hz,
where the Capture is the difference between two consecutive TIM2 captures. 

The minimum frequency value to measure is 1Hz.
