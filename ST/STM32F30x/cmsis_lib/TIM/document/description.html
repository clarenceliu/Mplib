<h1>TIM</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
  Advanced-control timers (TIM1/TIM8).The advanced-control timers (TIM1/TIM8) consist of a 16-bit auto-reload counter driven by a programmable prescaler.
It may be used for a variety of purposes, including measuring the pulse lengths of input signals (input capture) or generating output waveforms (output compare, PWM, complementary PWM with dead-time insertion).
Pulse lengths and waveform periods can be modulated from a few microseconds to several 
milliseconds using the timer prescaler and the RCC clock controller prescalers.
TIM1/TIM8 timer features include:
	<li>16-bit up, down, up/down auto-reload counter.</li>
	<li>16-bit programmable prescaler allowing dividing (also ¡°on the fly¡±) the counter clock frequency either by any factor between 1 and 65536. </li>
    	<li> Up to 6 independent channels for:
	Input Capture (but channels 5 and 6)
	Output Compare
	PWM generation (Edge and Center-aligned Mode)
	One-pulse mode output</li>
    	<li>Synchronization circuit to control the timer with external signals and to interconnect several timers together.    </li>
 

General-purpose timers (TIM2/TIM3/TIM4):The general-purpose timers consist of a 16-bit or 32-bit auto-reload counter driven by a programmable prescaler.
They may be used for a variety of purposes, including measuring the pulse lengths of input 
signals (input capture) or generating output waveforms (output compare and PWM).
Pulse lengths and waveform periods can be modulated from a few microseconds to several 
milliseconds using the timer prescaler and the RCC clock controller prescalers.
    	<li>16-bit (TIM3 and TIM4) or 32-bit (TIM2) up, down, up/down auto-reload counter.</li>
    	<li>16-bit programmable prescaler used to divide (also ¡°on the fly¡±) the counter clock frequency by any factor between 1 and 65535. </li>
    	<li>  Supports incremental (quadrature) encoder and hall-sensor circuitry for positioning purposes </li>

 

General-purpose timers (TIM15/16/17):The TIM15/16/17 timers consist of a 16-bit auto-reload counter driven by a programmable prescaler.
They may be used for a variety of purposes, including measuring the pulse lengths of input 
signals (input capture) or generating output waveforms (output compare, PWM, complementary PWM with dead-time insertion).
Pulse lengths and waveform periods can be modulated from a few microseconds to several 
milliseconds using the timer prescaler and the RCC clock controller prescalers.
    	<li>16-bit auto-reload upcounter</li>
