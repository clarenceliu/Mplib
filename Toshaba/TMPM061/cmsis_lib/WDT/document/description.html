<h1>WDT</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
    The watchdog timer (WDT) is for detecting malfunctions (runaways) of the CPU caused by noises or
    other disturbances and remedying them to return the CPU to normal operation. If the timer detects a
    runaway, it generates a non-maskable interrupt or an internal reset to notify the CPU. The watchdog
    timer starts immediately after reset release.
    </li>
</ul>
