    <Description>
		This example provides a short description of how to use the ADC peripheral to 
		convert a regular channel in Triple interleaved mode using DMA in mode 2 with 
		6Msps .

		The Triple interleaved delay is configured 5 ADC clk cycles.

		In Triple ADC mode, three DMA requests are generated: 
		- On the first request, both ADC2 and ADC1 data are transferred (ADC2 data take 
		  the upper half-word and ADC1 data take the lower half-word). 
		- On the second request, both ADC1 and ADC3 data are transferred (ADC1 data take
		  the upper half-word and ADC3 data take the lower half-word).
		- On the third request, both ADC3 and ADC2 data are transferred (ADC3 data take 
		  the upper half-word and ADC2 data take the lower half-word) and so on.

		On each DMA request (two data items are available) two half-words representing 
		two ADC-converted data items are transferred as a word.
