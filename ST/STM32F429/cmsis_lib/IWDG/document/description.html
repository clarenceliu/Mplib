<h1>IWDT</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
The independent watchdog (IWDG) is clocked by its own dedicated low-speed clock (LSI) and thus stays active even if the main clock fails. 
    <li>Free-running downcounter</li>
	<li>clocked from an independent RC oscillator (can operate in Standby and Stop modes)</li>
	<li>Reset (if watchdog activated) when the downcounter value of 0x000 is reached</li>
</ul>
