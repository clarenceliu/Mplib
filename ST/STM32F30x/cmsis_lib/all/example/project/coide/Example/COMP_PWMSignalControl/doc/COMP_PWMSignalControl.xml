   This example shows how to configure COMP1 peripheral to hold on safe state
(high level) TIM1 channels as soon as COMP1 output is set at high level.

  - COMP1 is configured as following:
     - Inverting input is internally connected to VREFINT = 1.22V
     - Non Inverting input is connected to PA1
     - Output is internally connected to TIM1 BKIN (Break Input)

  - TIM1CLK is set to 72 MHz, the TIM1 Prescaler is equal to 0 so the TIM1 counter
    clock used is 72 MHz.
    TIM1 frequency is defined as follow:
    TIM1 channels frequency = TIM1 counter clock / (Period + 1) 
                            = 72000000 /(100 + 1) 
                            = 713 KHz.

  - External voltage should be connected to PA.01 (RV2 potentiometer can be used).

  - Connect an oscilloscope to TIM1 channel PA.08 to display waveform. 

  - While PA.01 is lower than VREFINT (1.22V), PWM signal is displayed on PA.08.
    While PA.01 is higher than VREFINT, PA.08 is in high level.
