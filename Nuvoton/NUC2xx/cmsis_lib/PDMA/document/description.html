<h1>PDMA</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NUC200 series DMA contains nine-channel peripheral direct memory access
(PDMA) controller and a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) generator.
The PDMA that transfers data to and from memory or transfer data to and from APB devices. For
PDMA channel (PDMA CH0~CH8), there is one-word buffer as transfer buffer between the
Peripherals APB devices and Memory. Software can stop the PDMA operation by disable PDMA
PDMA_CSRx[PDMACEN]. The CPU can recognize the completion of a PDMA operation by
software polling or when it receives an internal PDMA interrupt. The PDMA controller can
increase source or destination address or fixed them as well.
The DMA controller contains a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) generator that can perform CRC
calculation with programmable polynomial settings. The CRC engine supports CPU PIO mode
and DMA transfer mode.</li>
