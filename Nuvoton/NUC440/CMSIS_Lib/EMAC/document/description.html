<h1>EMAC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>This chip provides an Ethernet MAC Controller (EMAC) for Network application. 
The Ethernet MAC controller consists of IEEE 802.3/Ethernet protocol engine with internal CAM 
function  for  recognizing  Ethernet  MAC  addresses,  Transmit-FIFO,  Receive-FIFO,  TX/RX  state 
machine controller, time stamping engine for IEEE 1588, Magic Packet parsing engine and status 
controller. 
The  EMAC  supports  both  the  MII  and  RMII  (Reduced  MII)  interface  to  connect  with  external 
Ethernet PHY. </li>
