<h1>DAC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The DAC module is a 12-bit, voltage output digital-to-analog converter. The DAC can be configured in 8- or 12-bit mode and may be used in conjunction with the DMA controller. In 12-bit mode, the data could be left- or right-aligned. The DAC has two output channels, each with its own converter. In dual DAC channel mode, conversions could be done independently or simultaneously when both channels are grouped together for synchronous update operations. An input reference pin, VREF+ (shared with ADC) is available for better resolution.</li>
</ul>
