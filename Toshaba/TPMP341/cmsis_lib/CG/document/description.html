<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The clock/mode control block enables to select clock gear, prescaler clock and warm-up of the PLL
(including clock multiplication circuit) and oscillator.<br />
The low power consumption mode can reduce power consumption.<br />
This chapter describes how to control clocks, clock operating modes and mode transitions. <br />
The clock/mode control block has the following functions:<br />
</p>
<p>
<ul>
    <li> Controls the oscillator.</li>
    <li> Controls the system clock.</li>
    <li> Controls the prescaler clock.</li>
    <li> Controls the PLL multiplication circuit.</li>
    <li> Controls the warm-up timer.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
In addition to NORMAL mode, the TMPM370FY can operate in two types of low power mode to reduce
power consumption according to its usage conditions.<br />
