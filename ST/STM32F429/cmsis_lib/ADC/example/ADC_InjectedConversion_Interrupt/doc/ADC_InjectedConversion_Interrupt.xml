    <Description>
		This example describes how to interrupt continuous ADC3 regular channel8 conversion 
		using ADC3 injected channel12 and how to get the converted value of this conversion.

		The ADC3 is configured to convert continuously regular channel8(for STM324x9I-EVAL RevB)
		and convert injected channel12 (connected to PC.2) when injected conversion starts
		(after one seconde of the start of regular channel).

		Each time a regular channel end of conversion occurs an interrupt is generated 
		and the converted data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedRegValue 
		variable in the ADC conversion complete callback function. After one seconde of
		the start of regular channel8 conversion the injected channel12 conversion starts 
		so regular conversion is temporary interrupted until the end of injected conversion. 
		When the injected conversion is finished, an interrupt is generated, and the  
		converted injected data of ADC3 DR register is affected to the uhADCxConvertedInjValue  
		variable in the ADC conversion complete callback function.     

		In this example, the system clock is 144MHz, APB2 = 72MHz and ADC clock = APB2/2. 
		Since ADC3 clock is 36 MHz and sampling time is set to 3 cycles, the conversion 
		time to 12bit data is 12 cycles so the total conversion time is (12+3)/36= 0.41us(2.4Msps).
