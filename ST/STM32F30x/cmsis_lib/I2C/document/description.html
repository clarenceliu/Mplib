<h1>I2C</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
	The I2C (inter-integrated circuit) bus interface handles communications between the 
microcontroller and the serial I2C bus. It provides multimaster capability, and controls all I2C bus-specific sequencing, protocol, arbitration and timing. It supports standard speed mode, Fast Mode and Fast Mode Plus.It is also SMBus (system management bus) and PMBus (power management bus) compatible.
	I2C main features    
	<li>I2C bus specification rev03 compatibility:
每 Slave and master modes
每 Multimaster capability
每 Standard mode (up to 100 kHz)
每 Fast Mode (up to 400 kHz)
每 Fast Mode Plus (up to 1 MHz)
每 7-bit and 10-bit addressing mode 
每 Multiple 7-bit slave addresses (2 addresses, 1 with configurable mask)
每 All 7-bit addresses acknowledge mode 
每 General call
每 Programmable setup and hold times
每 Easy to use event management
每 Optional clock stretching
每 Software reset</li>
	<li>1-byte buffer with DMA capability</li>
	<li>Programmable analog and digital noise filters</li>
	<li> SMBus specification rev 2.0 compatibility:
每 Hardware PEC (Packet Error Checking) generation and verification with ACK control
每 Command and data acknowledge control
每 Address resolution protocol (ARP) support
每 Host and Device support
每 SMBus alert
每 Timeouts and idle condition detection</li>
	<li>PMBus rev 1.1 standard compatibility</li>
	<li>Independent clock: a choice of independent clock sources allowing the I2C 
communication speed to be independent from the PCLK reprogramming </li>
	<li>Wakeup from Stop on address match. </li>
</ul>
