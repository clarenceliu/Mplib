<h1>ADC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The 12-bit ADC is a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter. It has up to 42 multiplexed channels allowing it measure signals from up to 40 external and two internal sources. The A/D conversion of the channels can be performed in single, continuous, scan or discontinuous mode. The result of the ADC is stored into a left- or right-aligned 16-bit data register.</li>
</ul>
