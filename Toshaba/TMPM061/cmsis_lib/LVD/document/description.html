<h1>LVD</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>

<pre>

The low voltage detection circuit consists of a reference voltage generation circuit,
comparators and control reg-isters. Supply voltage is divided by a ladder resistor and
input to the voltage selection circuit. In the voltage selection cir-cuit, a voltage is
chosen according to the detected voltage then compared with the reference voltage in
the compa-rator. If the supply voltage is upper/lower than the detected voltage, an
interrupt signal occurs.
