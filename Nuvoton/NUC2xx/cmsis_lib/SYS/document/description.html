<h1>SYS</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>System management includes the following sections:
 System Resets
 System Memory Map
 System management registers for Part Number ID, chip reset and on-chip controllers
reset , multi-functional pin control
 System Timer (SysTick)
 Nested Vectored Interrupt Controller (NVIC)
 System Control registers</li>
 <li>The clock controller generates clocks for the whole chip, including system clocks and all
peripheral clocks. The clock controller also implements the power control function with the
individually clock ON/OFF control, clock source selection and clock divider. The chip enters
Power-down mode when Cortex?-M0 core executes the WFI instruction only if the
PWR_DOWN_EN (PWRCON[7]) bit and PD_WAIT_CPU (PWRCON[8]) bit are both set to 1.
After that, chip enters Power-down mode and waits for wake-up interrupt source triggered to exit
Power-down mode. In Power-down mode, the clock controller turns off the external 4~24 MHz
high speed crystal and internal 22.1184 MHz high speed oscillator to reduce the overall system
power consumption.</li>
</ul>
