<h1>CAN</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The C_CAN consists of the CAN Core, Message RAM, Message Handler, Control Registers and 
Module  Interface.  The  CAN  Core  performs  communication  according  to 
the  CAN  protocol  version  2.0  part  A  and  B.  The  bit  rate  can  be  programmed  to  values  up  to 
1MBit/s. For the connection to the physical layer, additional transceiver hardware is required. 
For communication on a CAN network, individual Message Objects are configured. The Message 
Objects  and  Identifier  Masks  for  acceptance  filtering  of  received  messages  are  stored  in  the 
Message  RAM.  All  functions  concerning  the  handling  of  messages  are  implemented  in  the 
Message  Handler.  These  functions  include  acceptance  filtering,  the  transfer  of  messages 
between the CAN Core and the Message RAM, and the handling of transmission requests as well 
as the generation of the module interrupt. 
The  register  set  of  the  C_CAN  can  be  accessed  directly  by  the  software  through  the  module 
interface. These registers are used to control/configure the CAN Core and the Message Handler 
and to access the Message RAM. </li>
