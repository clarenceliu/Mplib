<h1>AES</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The AES hardware accelerator can be used to  both encipher and decipher data using AES algorithm. It is a fully compliant implementation of the following standard:The advanced encryption standard (AES) as defined by Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS PUB 197, 2001 November 26).The accelerator encrypts and decrypts 128-bit blocks using 128-bit key length. It can also perform key derivation. The encryption or decryption key is stored in an internal register in order to minimize write operations by the CPU or DMA when processing several data blocks using the same key. </li>
