<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The  NUC400  series  has  up  to  144  General  Purpose  I/O  pins  shared  with  other  function  pins 
depending  on  the  chip  configuration.  These  144  pins  are  arranged  in  9  ports  named  GPIOA, GPIOB, GPIOC, GPIOD, GPIOE, GPIOF, GPIOG, GPIOH and GPIOI. GPIO has 16 pins on echo port]. Each one of the 144 pins isindependent and has the corresponding register bits to control the pin mode function and data.  </li>
