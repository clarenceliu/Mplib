<h1>EXTI</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The external interrupt/event controller consists of up to 24 (or 23 for low and  medium density devices) edge detectors for generating  event/interrupt requests. Each input line can be independently configured to select the type (event or interrupt) and the corresponding trigger event (rising edge, falling edge or both). Each line can also be masked independently. A pending register maintains  the status line of the interrupt requests.</li>
</ul>
