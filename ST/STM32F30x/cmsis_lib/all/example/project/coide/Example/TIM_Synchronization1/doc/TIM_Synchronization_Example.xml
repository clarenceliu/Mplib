    <Description>
        This example shows how to synchronize TIM peripherals in cascade mode.
In this example three timers are used:

Timers synchronisation in cascade mode:

1/TIM2 is configured as Master Timer:
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The TIM2 Update event is used as Trigger Output

2/TIM3 is slave for TIM2
 - PWM Mode is used
 - The ITR1(TIM2) is used as input trigger 
 - Gated mode is used, so start and stop of slave counter
   are controlled by the Master trigger output signal(TIM2 update event).

The TIM2 counter clock is 72 MHz.

  The Master Timer TIM2 is running at TIM2 frequency :
  TIM2 frequency = (TIM2 counter clock)/ (TIM2 period + 1) = 281.25 KHz 
  and the duty cycle = TIM2_CCR1/(TIM2_ARR + 1) = 25%.

  The TIM3 is running at:
  (TIM2 frequency)/ (TIM3 period + 1) = 28.125 KHz and a duty cycle equal 
  to TIM3_CCR1/(TIM3_ARR + 1) = 40%

  The TIM4 is running at:
  (TIM3 frequency)/ (TIM4 period + 1) = 7.031 Hz and a duty cycle equal 
  to TIM4_CCR1/(TIM4_ARR + 1) = 50%

     - Connect the following pins to an oscilloscope to monitor the different 
      waveforms:
        - TIM2 CH1 (PA.00) 
        - TIM3 CH1 (PA.06)
        - TIM4 CH1 (PB.06)
