<h1>FSMC</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The FSMC block is able to interface with  synchronous and asynchronous memories. Its main purpose is to: Translate the AHB transactions into the appropriate external device protocol, Meet the access timing requirements of the external devices. All external memories share the addresses, data and control signals with the controller. Each external device is accessed by means of a unique chip select. The FSMC performs only one access at a time to an external device.</li>
</ul>
