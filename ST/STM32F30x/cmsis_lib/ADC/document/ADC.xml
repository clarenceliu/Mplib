  <Description>Analog-to-digital converters. This section describes the implementation of up to 4 ADCs:
			ADC1 and ADC2 are tightly coupled and can operate in dual mode (ADC1 is master);
			ADC3 and ADC4 are tightly coupled and can operate in dual mode (ADC3 is master).
  Each ADC consists of 12-bit ADC is a successive approximation analog-to-digital converter.
Each ADC has up to 19 multiplexed channels allowing the measurements of up to 16 
external sources and up to three internal sources. A/D conversion of the various channels 
can be performed in single, continuous, scan or discontinuous mode. The result of the ADC 
is stored in a left-aligned or right-aligned 16-bit data register.
The ADCs are mapped on the AHB bus to allow fast data handling.
The analog watchdog features allow the application to detect if the input voltage goes 
outside the user-defined high or low thresholds.
An efficient low power mode is implemented to allow very low consumption at low frequency.
