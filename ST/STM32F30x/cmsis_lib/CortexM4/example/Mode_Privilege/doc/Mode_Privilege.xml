This example shows how to modify CortexM4 Thread mode privilege access and stack.
CortexM4 Thread mode is entered on Reset, and can be entered as a result of an
exception return.  

The associated program is used to:

1. Switch the Thread mode stack from Main stack to Process stack

2. Switch the Thread mode from Privileged to Unprivileged

3. Switch the Thread mode from Unprivileged back to Privileged

To monitor the stack used and the privileged or unprivileged access level of code
in Thread mode, a set of variables is available within the program. It is also
possible to use the 'Cortex register' window of the debugger.
