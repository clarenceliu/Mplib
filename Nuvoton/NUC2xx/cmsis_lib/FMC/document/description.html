<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>NThe NuMicro NUC200 Series has 128/64/32K bytes on-chip embedded Flash for application
program memory (APROM) that can be updated through ISP procedure. The In-System-
Programming (ISP) function enables user to update program memory when chip is soldered on
PCB. After chip is powered on, Cortex?-M0 CPU fetches code from APROM or LDROM decided
by boot select (CBS) in Config0. By the way, the NuMicro NUC200 Series also provides
additional DATA Flash for user to store some application dependent data. For 128K bytes
APROM device, the data flash is shared with original 128K program memory and its start address
is configurable in Config1. For 64K/32K bytes APROM device, the data flash is fixed at 4K. </li>
