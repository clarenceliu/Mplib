    <Description>
   This example shows how to configure the TIM peripheral to generate an Asymetric signal.
TIM8 is configured to generate an Asymetric signal with a programmable Phase-Shifted signal on TIM8_CH2:
	 - TIM8 Channel 1 is configured in PWM2 mode
	 - TIM8 Channel 2 is configured in Asymetric PWM2 mode
	 - The counter mode is center aligned mode
	 - The pulse length and the phase shift are programmed consecutively in TIM8_CCR2 and TIM8_CCR1.

TIM1 is configured to generating the reference signal on Channel1 used by TIM8:
	 - TIM1 is generating a PWM signal with frequency equal to 1.6363 KHz.
	 - TIM1 is used as master for TIM8, the update event of TIM1 genarates the Reset counter of TIM8 to synchronize the two signals: the refernce signal (TIM1_CH1) and the shifted signal (TIM8_CH2). 
	   
In this example TIM1 and TIM8 input clock (TIM8CLK) is set to APB2 clock (PCLK2)    
TIM1 and TIM8 signals are at frequency of  (SystemCoreClock / (Period + 1))  
               
TIM8 is generating a signal with the following caracteristics:
	- Pulse lenght = (TIM8_CCR1 + TIM8_CCR2) / TIM8_CLK
	- Phase shift = TIM8_CCR2/TIM8_CLK
 with TIM8_CLK = (SystemCoreClock / (Period + 1)), as the prescaler is equal to zero. 
 The Pulse is low level of the output signal of Channel 2 because TIM cannel is configured as Asymetric PWM2 mode.
