    <Description>
   This example shows how to enter the system to STOP mode and wake-up using EXTI
Line interrupts. The EXTI Line sources are PE.6 and RTC Alarm.

The EXTI line6 is configured to generate interrupt on falling edge.
The EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is configured to generate interrupt on rising edge.

The system enters and exits STOP mode as following:
After system start-up, the RTC is configured to generate an Alarm event then the 
system enters STOP mode. To wake-up from STOP mode you have to apply a falling
edge on EXTI line0, otherwise the  RTC Alarm will wake-up the system within 5 
seconds. After exit from STOP, the system clock is reconfigured to its previous 
state (as HSE and PLL are disabled in STOP mode).
Then, after a delay the system will enter again in STOP mode and exit in the way
described above. This behavior is repeated in an infinite loop.

Three leds LD2, LD3 and LD4 are used to monitor the system state as following:
 - LD3 Toggling: system in RUN mode
 - All LED off: system in STOP mode
 - LD2 is on if EXTI Line6 is used to exit from STOP
 - LD4 is on if EXTI line17(RTC Alarm) is used to exit from STOP
