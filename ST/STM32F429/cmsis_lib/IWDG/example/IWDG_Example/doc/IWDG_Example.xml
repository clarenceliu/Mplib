    <Description>
The independent watchdog (IWDG) is clocked by its own dedicated low-speed clock (LSI) 
and thus stays active even if the main clock fails. The window watchdog (WWDG) clock is 
prescaled from the APB1 clock and has a configurable time-window that can be 
programmed to detect abnormally late or early application behavior.

The EXTI Line is used to simulate a software failure: once the EXTI Line event 
occurs, by pressing the Key push-button, the corresponding interrupt is served.
If the EXTI Line event does not occur, the IWDG counter is indefinitely refreshed
in the main program infinite loop, and there is no IWDG reset.
