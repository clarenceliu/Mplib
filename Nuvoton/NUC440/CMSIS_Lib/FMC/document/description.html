<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The NUC400 is equipped with 256/512K bytes on-chip embedded flash for application program 
memory  (APROM)  and  data  flash  that  can  be  updated  through  ISP  procedure.  In-System-
Programming (ISP) and In-Application-Programming (IAP) enables user to update chip embedded 
flash when chip is soldered on PCB. After chip is powered on, Cortex-M4 CPU fetches code from 
APROM  or  LDROM  decided  by  boot  select  (CBS)  in  Config0.  By  the  way,  the  NUC400  also 
provides Data Flash for user to store some application dependent data before chip is powered off. 
The NUC400 supports another flexible feature: configurable data flash size. The data flash size is 
decided  by  data  flash  enable  (DFEN)  in  Config0  and  data  flash  base  address  (DFBADR)  in 
Config1. When DFEN is set to 1, the data flash size is zero. When DFEN is set to 0, the APROM 
and data flash share 256/512K bytes continuous address and the start address of data flash  is 
defined by (DFBADR) in Config1.</li>
