<h1>UART</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART) performs a serial-to-parallel
conversion on data received from the peripheral, and a parallel-to-serial conversion on data
transmitted from the CPU. 
The UART0 and UART1 are built-in with a 16-byte transmitter FIFO (TX_FIFO) and a 14-byte
receiver FIFO (RX_FIFO) that reduces the number of interrupts presented to the CPU. The CPU
can read the status of the UART at any time during the operation. The reported status information
includes the type and condition of the transfer operations being performed by the UART, as well
as 4 error conditions (parity error, framing error, break interrupt and buffer error) probably occur
while receiving data. The UART includes a programmable baud rate generator that is capable of
dividing clock input by divisors to produce the serial clock that transmitter and receiver need.</li>
