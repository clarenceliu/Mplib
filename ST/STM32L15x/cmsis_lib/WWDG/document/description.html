<h1>WWDG</h1>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<ul>
    <li>The window watchdog is used to detect the occurrence of a software fault, usually generated by external interference or by unforeseen logical conditions, which causes the application program to abandon its normal sequence. The watchdog circuit generates an MCU reset on expiry of a programmed time period, unless the program refreshes the contents of the downcounter before the T6 bit becomes cleared. An MCU reset is also generated if the 7-bit downcounter value (in the control register) is refreshed before the downcounter has reached the window register value. This implies that the counter must be refreshed in a limited window.</li>
</ul>
